Olá / Hello / ¡Hola! 👋, my name is Bruno Casali (**@brunoocasali** everywhere), I'm from 🇧🇷.

I'm currently working as the Integrations Manager at [Meilisearch 🇫🇷](https://github.com/meilisearch) since Jan/22.

I really like contributing to open-source and finally I could make that my job :)
I hope to see you in the Meili's pull requests and issues!

Best,
