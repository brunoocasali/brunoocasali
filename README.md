OlÃ¡ / Hello / Â¡Hola! ğŸ‘‹, my name is Bruno Casali (**@brunoocasali** everywhere), I'm from ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡·.

I was the Integrations Manager at [Meilisearch ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·](https://github.com/meilisearch) from Jan/22 to Jun/23.  
Now I'm working at the Meilisearch Cloud ğŸ¦­ğŸ¥°

I like contributing to open-source, and finally, I could make that my job :)  
I hope to see you in Meili's pull requests and issues!

Best,
