OlÃ¡ / Hello / Â¡Hola! ğŸ‘‹, my name is Bruno Casali (**@brunoocasali** everywhere), I'm from ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡·.

I have been the Integrations Manager at [Meilisearch ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·](https://github.com/meilisearch) since Jan/22.

I really like contributing to open-source, and finally, I could make that my job :)  
I hope to see you in Meili's pull requests and issues!

Best,
